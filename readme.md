Everytime if numerical appear in plain/cipher text error message popup
Everytime if a blank column is present error message popup
Message box: 
AFFINE:
	ENCRYPTION:
	plain text should be alphabetic characters.Numericals are not allowed in plain text. Key1 should have multiplicative inverse in modulo 26.

	DECRYPTION:
	cipher text should be alphabetic characters.Numericals are not allowed in plain text. Key1 should have multiplicative inverse in modulo 26.

	
	CRYPTANALYSIS:
	message :cipher text = alphabets only 
	doubt and correction:
	updated words list with more words?
	analyse cryptanalysis.py file and make changes as mentioned.
	
	
HILL:

	ENCRYPTION:
	key size = size of key matrix
	key = alphabetic characters only with length key size*2
	plain text = alphabets 
	boguz characters will be added (eg: z, yz, xyz, wxyz) as required
	
	DECRYPTION:
	ciphertext must be a multiple of the key matrix size
	key size = size of key matrix
	key = alphabetic characters only with length key size*2, key should be necessarily invertible. if non invertible matrix added then show error message.
	cipher text = alphabets 
	boguz characters will be added (eg: z, yz, xyz, wxyz) as required
	
	CRYPTANALYSIS:
	plain and cipher text should be alphabets.
	
SHIFT/CAESER:
	Caeser cipher is choosen then key should not be present:
	ENCRYPTION:
	plain text = alphabets 
	key = numericals
	
	DECRYPTION:
	cipher text = alphabets 
	key = numericals
	
	CRYPTANALYSIS:
	cipher text = alphabets
	//no need of ceaser cipher crypt analysis in cryptanalysis page

VIGENERE CIPHER:
	Ensure naming is correct "Vigenere"
	ENCRYPTION:
	plain text = alphabets
	key = alphabets
	
	ERROR:
	recheck everything !!
	after encryption reach shift cipher page
	
	DECRYPTION:
	cipher text = alphabets
	key = alphabets
